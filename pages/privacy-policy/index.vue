						take additional steps in order to ensure that your personal data is treated just as safely and securely as it would be within
						the UK;
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						We ensure that your personal data is protected under binding corporate rules. Binding corporate rules are a set of common
						rules which all our group companies are required to follow when processing personal data. For further information, please

					<p class="mb-4">
						The security of your personal data is essential to us, and to protect your data, we take a number of important measures,
						including the following:
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							limiting access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors, and other third parties with a legitimate
							need to know and ensuring that they are subject to duties of confidentiality;
						</li>
						<li>
							procedures for dealing with data breaches (the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised
							disclosure of, or access to, your personal data) including notifying you and/or the ICO where we are legally required to
							do so;
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring
						at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc ml-5 mb-4">
						<li>
							We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for
							personal data.
						</li>
						<li>
							Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved for use in the UK which give personal data
							the same protection it has in the UK.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data
						out of the UK.
					</p>
					<h3 class="text-2xl lg:text-xl font-bold border-b pb-4 mb-4">7. Data security</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or
						accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees,
						agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our
						instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable
						regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
					</p>
					<h3 class="text-2xl lg:text-xl font-bold border-b pb-4 mb-4">8. Data retention</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						<strong>How long will you use my personal data for?</strong>
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for,
						including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting, recruitment or reporting requirements. We may
						retain your personal data for a longer period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is a prospect of
						litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						With regards to data specific to
						<em>HR internal/external recruitment related Data for us/our clientele</em>
						purposes, If you are successfully recruited to us or our clientele, the information you provide during the application process
						will be retained by us as part of your employee file for the duration of your employment plus 6 (six) years following the end
						of your employment. This includes your criminal records declaration, fitness to work, records of any security checks and
						references.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the
						personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we
						process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal,
						regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data: see below for further information.</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						In some circumstances we will anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or
						statistical purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.
					</p>
					<h3 class="text-2xl lg:text-xl font-bold border-b pb-4 mb-4">9. Your legal rights</h3>
					<p class="mb-4">
						Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data. Please click on the
						link below to find out more about these rights:
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						<a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/"
							>Guide to the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) | ICO</a
						>
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">You have the right to:</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						<strong>Request access</strong> to your personal data (commonly known as a “data subject access request”). This enables you to
						receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						<strong>Request correction </strong>
						of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you
						corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						<strong>Request erasure </strong>of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove personal data where
						there is no good reason for us continuing to process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal
						data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to processing (see below), where we may have processed your
						information unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply with local law. Note, however, that we
						may not always be able to comply with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified to you, if
						applicable, at the time of your request.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						<strong>Object to processing </strong>of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third
						party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as
						you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object where we are processing your
						personal data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to
						process your information which override your rights and freedoms.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						<strong>Request restriction of processing</strong> of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing
						of your personal data in the following scenarios:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc ml-5 mb-4">
						<li>If you want us to establish the data’s accuracy.</li>
						<li>Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase it.</li>
						<li>
							Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal
							claims.
						</li>
						<li>
							You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="mb-4">
						<strong>Request the transfer</strong>of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you, or a third
						party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only
						applies to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to
						perform a contract with you.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">
						<strong>Withdraw consent at any time</strong>where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However, this will
						not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may
						not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw
						your consent.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-4">If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please contact us.</p>
					<h4 class="text-lg mb-3 font-bold">
						<strong>No fee usually required</strong>
					</h4>
					<p class="mb-4">
						You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a
						reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive. Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with
						your request in these circumstances.
					</p>
					<h4 class="text-lg mb-3 font-bold">
						<strong>What we may need from you</strong>
					</h4>
					<p class="mb-4">
						We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your
						personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not
						disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation
						to your request to speed up our response.
					</p>
					<h4 class="text-lg mb-3 font-bold">
						<strong>Time limit to respond</strong>
					</h4>
					<p class="mb-4">
						We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your
						request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

					<p class="mb-4">
						<strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us
						to give you the best service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any
						potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate
						interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we
						have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess
						our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.
